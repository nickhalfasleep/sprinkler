# sprinkler
My python script for running sprinklers with a Raspberry Pi

This uses a SainSmart 8-Channel Relay Module over the GPIO pins to run my sprinklers. The python program is execuded by a cron job.

It needs refactorying and cleanup, but works right now.

Future improvments:
-Check my weather station for precipitation.
-Check a weather report for precipitation, humidity, and temperature and adjust the times accordingly.
